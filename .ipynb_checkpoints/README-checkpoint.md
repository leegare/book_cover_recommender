If you google “How do I choose a new book?”, you might get results like: 
Take suggestions/recommendations of the 3 F's. Friends, Family and Fools, know what do you like to read, read Top books from top authors, take online reviews of the book. For example Goodreads is one reliable source when in the dilemma, before buying, read the back cover contents, [1] etc. 

A first filter is usually by author, category, or recomendation / rumor… and then? Normally those filters should be enough or they could act in tandem to optimize your choice. Your decision concretizes when you read the description and/or reviews and are satisfied with their choice. 

A book’s cover gives us an idea on what the book is about. There is so much sparse data such that a book can be in the best sellers list but has no reviews! What else would the reader rely on to base its decision?  “Cover images and text must be clearly understood as thumbnails, which is how more books are being sold today [8].

A book’s cover design determines the purchase eight out of ten times. [9] -Paraphrase:- Not only is your cover a “key piece of the puzzle,” it is definitely the most important decision you will make since the average person will base their purchase decision on looking at your cover for about 3 – 5 seconds.

### What makes a best seller? 

The general consensus is that if you want to make your way onto a best-seller list, any best-seller list, you have to sell at least 5,000 books in a week, or maybe 10,000. Beyond that, things get complicated depending on which list you’re looking to end up on [7].

That’s because the different lists don’t all use the same data. No one has access to all of the sales made by every single book published in the US in a given week. Moreover different best-seller lists have their own methodologies to gather and classify data. 

So all of the different best-seller lists have established their own methodologies to gather sales data — and once they’ve got it, they break it down differently. They put the break between one week and another in different spots (ending on Sunday versus Saturday, for example); they use different categories to sort the lists; they weigh digital and print titles differently. Here’s a breakdown of how the five major lists — Publishers Weekly, USA Today, Indiebound, Amazon, and the New York Times — work.

Becoming a New York Times best-seller has a measurable effect on a book’s sales, especially for books by debut authors. 
However their classification algorithm has some loopholes [7]: 
An author can buy its way onto the list 
Rumors said the list was biased against conservatives

So were they better written? Did they have stronger covers? Were they just lucky? 
Jonny Geller [2], a literary agent, believes that “it is absolutely crucial if a book is to become a big best selling book you have to be able to communicate the core idea easily” (enter the cover and description). 

Writing a good book description isn't just about telling readers what your book's about once they find it; it's about telling search engines what search queries your book could answer so that they actually can find it [9].

In a bookstore, the cover is a big deal—it's the first impression of your brand. And first impressions matter [10].
