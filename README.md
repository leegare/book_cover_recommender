# book_cover_recommender
#### Capstone project ~ Work in Progress

## Introduction

In average the reader will base their purchase decision by looking at the cover for about 3 to 5 seconds. A book’s cover design determines the purchase eight out of ten times **[1]**. Jonny Geller, a literary agent, believes that “it is absolutely crucial if a book is to become a big best selling book you have to be able to communicate the core idea easily”**[2]**. Enter the book's cover! This is because a book cover is a key piece of the puzzle, it's the first visual contact between the book and the reader and first impressions matter 

In this project I will analyze around 10,000 book covers from a public database to detect the underlying patterns that can be learnt from the reader. Then, use this information to build a recommender system based solely on the book's cover and see if judging a book by its cover isn't a sin at all.  

## The dataset

The data is extracted from a github repo **[3]**.
